<p>Learn about me at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wmellis1/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/wmellis1/</a></p> My first introduction to ML concepts was in the wonderful statistics elective 'Applications of Multivariate Analysis Methods in Business Research' at NYU/Stern School of Business and I continue to be as excited about the subject as I was then.
<p>My GitHub primarily showcases code I've written in numerous projects from Machine/Deep Learning courses I have completed - and also any interesting side projects I&rsquo;ve done (no work-related product developed on behalf of my employers is included here). &nbsp;</p>

<li><strong>Homer Simpson, Precision (PPV), Recall and the Confusion Matrix? </strong>Yes! I developed a fun interactive Tableau dashboard which allows users to get a <em>practical</em> grasp of these crucial (and sometimes slippery, even for senior leaders) statistical concepts in classification models.</li>&nbsp; &nbsp; <a title="William Ellis - Classification Model Statistics Demo" href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/william.ellis3377/viz/MachineLearningClassificationModelingMetricsDemo/Dashboard">(Machine Learning) Classification Modeling Metrics Demo</a></li>
