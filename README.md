<p>My GitHub primarily showcases code I've written in numerous projects from Machine/Deep Learning courses I have completed - and also any interesting side projects I&rsquo;ve done (no work-related product developed on behalf of my employers is included here). &nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>My Content</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Homer Simpson, Precision (PPV), Recall and the Confusion Matrix? </strong>Yes! I developed a fun interactive Tableau dashboard which allows users to get a <em>practical</em> grasp of these crucial (and sometimes slippery, even for senior leaders) statistical concepts used in classification models.</li>
<li><strong>Udacity &lsquo;Deep Learning&rsquo; projects</strong> (2020; a 4 month intensive course I completed as part of a cohort sponsored by my employer. Modules/projects (only final projects here):
<ul>
<li>'Neural Networks' - 'Predicting Bike Sharing Data'</li>
<li>'Convolutional Networks' - 'Dog Breed Classifier'</li>
<li>'Recurrent Networks' - 'Generate TV Scripts'</li>
<li>'Generative Adversarial Networks' - 'Generate Faces'</li>
<li>'Deep Reinforcement Learning' - 'Teach a Quadcopter How to Fly'</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Udacity &lsquo;Natural Language Processing&rsquo; projects</strong> (2020; a 3 month intensive course I completed as part of a cohort sponsored by my employer.
<ul>
<li>'Introduction to NLP' - 'Part of Speech Tagging'</li>
<li>'Computing with Natural Language' - 'Machine Translation'</li>
<li>'Communicating with Natural Language' - 'DNN Speech Recognizer'</li>
</ul>
