Welcome to my GitHub! Please read the intro below and feel free to check out the links below and/or code in my repos (currently curating the latter).

My first introduction to ML concepts was in the wonderful statistics elective 'Applications of Multivariate Analysis Methods in Business Research' at New York University, Stern School of Business and I continue to be as excited about the subject as I was then.

My GitHub primarily showcases code I've written in numerous projects from Machine/Deep Learning courses I have completed - and also any interesting side projects I’ve done (no work-related product developed on behalf of my employer is included here).  

My Content
Homer Simpson, Precision (PPV), Recall and the Confusion Matrix? Yes! I developed a fun interactive Tableau dashboard which allows users to get a practical grasp of these crucial (and sometimes slippery, even for senior leaders) statistical concepts in classification models.
