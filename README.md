<p>My first introduction to ML concepts was in the wonderful statistics elective 'Applications of Multivariate Analysis Methods in Business Research' at New York University, Stern School of Business and I continue to be as excited about the subject as I was then.</p>
<p>My GitHub primarily showcases code I've written in numerous projects from Machine/Deep Learning courses I have completed - and also any interesting side projects I&rsquo;ve done (no work-related product developed on behalf of my employer is included here). &nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Precision (PPV), Recall, the Confusion Matrix and Homer Simpson? </strong>Yes! I developed a fun interactive Tableau dashboard which allows users to get a <em>practical</em> grasp of these crucial (and sometimes slippery, even for senior leaders) statistical concepts in classification models. <a title="William Ellis - Classification Model Statistics Demo" href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/william.ellis3377/viz/MachineLearningClassificationModelingMetricsDemo/Dashboard">Machine Learning - Classification Modeling Metrics Demo (view on computer)</a></li>
