Sorry ... currently under renovation! But you can read the intro below and feel free to  check out the code I'm currently curating in my repos. 




Welcome to my GitHub! Learn about me at https://www.linkedin.com/in/wmellis1/




My GitHub primarily showcases code I've written in numerous projects from Machine/Deep Learning courses I have completed - and also any interesting side projects I’ve done (no work-related product developed on behalf of my employers is included here).  

My Content
Homer Simpson, Precision (PPV), Recall and the Confusion Matrix? Yes! I developed a fun interactive Tableau dashboard which allows users to get a grasp of these crucial (and sometimes slippery, even for senior leaders) statistical concepts in classification models.
Udacity ‘Deep Learning’ projects (2020; a 4 month intensive course I completed as part of a cohort sponsored by my employer. Modules/projects (only final projects here):
'Neural Networks' - 'Predicting Bike Sharing Data'
'Convolutional Networks' - 'Dog Breed Classifier'
'Recurrent Networks' - 'Generate TV Scripts'
'Generative Adversarial Networks' - 'Generate Faces'
'Deep Reinforcement Learning' - 'Teach a Quadcopter How to Fly'
Udacity ‘Natural Language Processing’ projects (2020; a 3 month intensive course I completed as part of a cohort sponsored by my employer.

'Introduction to NLP' - 'Part of Speech Tagging'
'Computing with Natural Language' - 'Machine Translation'
'Communicating with Natural Language' - 'DNN Speech Recognizer'
Coursera/Univ. of Washingon 'Machine Learning Specialization' (2017; 4 courses - 'Foundations', 'Regression', and 'Classification', 'Clustering'.
